# VoxelEngine

Part of an unfinished game. This project effectively showcases multithreaded voxel generation in Unity (a la MineCraft) except that may not be as optimized. (Notch is a great programmer) The project so far has a fps camera attached to a capsule object along with a infinite map which has a terrain built up of voxels. The terrain is generated on the fly and may pop in at times. It uses perlin/simplex noise to generate the different terrain features.
